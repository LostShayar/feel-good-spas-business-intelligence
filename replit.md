## External Dependencies

### Required APIs
- **Groq API**: For free conversational AI functionality (Llama models)
- **API Key Management**: Environment variable GROQ_API_KEY required

### Python Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualization library
- **TextBlob**: Natural language processing for sentiment analysis
- **Groq**: Official Groq Python client for free AI models
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing support
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database toolkit and ORM for PostgreSQL integration
- **Psycopg2**: PostgreSQL database adapter for Python

### Data Dependencies
- **vCon Files**: Customer service conversation data in JSON format
- **Business Questions**: Pre-defined analytics queries in CSV format
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for API keys and settings
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Primary data storage with automatic failover to CSV

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- **Setup**: Python environment with required dependencies
- **Data Processing**: Run data_processor.py to generate processed_spa_data.csv
- **Application Launch**: streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000
- **Port Configuration**: Automatic forwarding to port 5000 for consistency

### Production Considerations
- **Scalability**: PostgreSQL database implemented for production-ready data storage
- **Security**: API key management through environment variables
- **Performance**: Database-optimized queries with CSV fallback for reliability
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging infrastructure with database admin interface

### Architecture Decisions

**Problem**: Need to process unstructured conversation data into business insights
**Solution**: Multi-stage pipeline with vCon parsing, enrichment, and analytics
**Alternatives**: Direct database integration, real-time streaming processing
**Pros**: Simple, maintainable, follows data standards (vCon format)
**Cons**: File-based storage limits scalability

**Problem**: Provide intuitive business intelligence interface
**Solution**: Streamlit multi-page application with role-based views
**Alternatives**: Traditional BI tools, custom React/Vue.js frontend
**Pros**: Rapid development, Python-native, good for analytics
**Cons**: Limited customization compared to custom frontend

**Problem**: Enable natural language data queries
**Solution**: Groq AI integration with business context for free usage
**Alternatives**: Custom NLP models, rule-based query systems, paid OpenAI
**Pros**: Advanced language understanding, minimal training required, completely free
**Cons**: External API dependency, but no usage costs

The system is designed for rapid prototyping and demonstration while maintaining extensibility for production deployment. The modular architecture allows for easy replacement of components as requirements evolve.
